- [x] Implement layout parsing
- [x] Implement index parsing
- [x] Change `layout` macro to `form` macro
- [x] Move `index` module inside `layout_config_ui` module
- [x] Differentiate form layout from show layout
- [x] Implement sections
- [x] Implement nested sections
- [x] Groups should have a calculated id to be used in rendering and tests.
- [x] Improve css on all: fields, sections and groups
- [x] Implement select
- [x] Default to stacked instead of inline
- [x] Normalize context functions
- [x] Create macro for adding a schema to the context and produce all the required functions
- [x] Meta data configuration should provide a callback method for getting the configuration.
    The idea is to be able to have a module containing all the metadata and be used 
    in the create_ui macro in another module.
- [ ] Implement associations
  - [ ] One to Many (Children)
    - [ ] Separate the index implementation in component and component user
    - [ ] Implement dual rendering behaviour for the `index` macro: As a main list or as a component
  - [ ] Many to One (reference)
- [ ] Implement @ fields (can read values from assigns)
- [ ] Implement conditional bases on @ fields or functions
- [ ] Implement switch
- [ ] Implement color component
- [ ] Consider pagination for the context functions
- [ ] Fix the views and input so they can be better
- [ ] Think about actions
- [ ] Think about conditionals
- [ ] Think about fragments
- [ ] Move the default configuration to a file, that will serve, also, as a template.
